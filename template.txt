@REPLACE1@ is a @REPLACE2@ processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. @REPLACE4@ can also read and execute @REPLACE6@ from a file, called a shell script.
Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, @REPLACE2@ substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh.
@REPLACE1@ is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions. Contact at @REPLACE8@.
